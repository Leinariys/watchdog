/**
 * Provides information on classes contained within a {@link ClassLoader}. The difference between this class and

 * the class in to the JVM. Parsing of the resource is done the same way as {@link FileSystemClassInformationRepository}.
 * <p>
 * This is an attempt to work around the issue with loading classes and {@link ClassFileTransformer} (something we need to do for resolving
 * stack map frames after instrumenting the class). If
 * {@link ClassFileTransformer#transform(java.lang.ClassLoader, java.lang.String, java.lang.Class, java.security.ProtectionDomain, byte[])}
 * calls {@link Class#forName(java.lang.String) } for a class that hasn't been passed to that transformer yet, that class will never get
 * passed to that transformer.
 * <p>
 * As a work-around, we load the class bytes and parse that rather than loading the actual class.

    //> Objet: [asm] ClassFileTransformer and ClassWriter
    //
    //> I noticed that if ClassFileTransformer.transform() calls Class.forName()
    //> for a class that hasn't been passed to that transformer yet, that class
    //> will never get passed to that transformer.
    //>
    //> It looks like ClassWriter uses Class.forName() when it computes frames.
    //> How is it that people can use ClassWriter within a ClassFileTransformer
    //> without running in to this problem? Is there special logic somewhere in
    //> ASM that handles this?
    //
    //If you want to write Java 1.6 compatible code, you have to generate stackmap frames,
    //ASM can do that for you but it needs to know how to find the common supertype of two types,
    //this is needed by example when you merge variables that comes from the two branches of an if
    //(if you know the SSA form, you need that everywhere you have a phi).
    //
    //ASM provides a default implementation, ClassWriter.getCommonSuperType() that relies on Class.forName,
    //which as you said is not something you should do if you are inside a ClassFileTransformer
    //(which is not re-entrant).
    //
    //To cope with that issue, you can load the classfile using classloader.getResources(), use ASM to find the supertypes and compute the
    //common super types.
    //
    //But i suppose that you already know all of this, (you are the author of watchdog, right ?) so to answer to your question, no, ASM
    //does not provide any code for dealing with that, you have to write your own.
    //
    //The other solution, which i think in your case is the right solution, is to not ask ASM to generate the stackmap for you, but read the
    //existing stackmap and patch them (in MethodVisitor.vuisitFrame), it's painful, but in your case, it's the only way i see to do your
    //transformations properly.
    //
    //ASM can call visitFrame with two forms:
    //  - the compressed form which is how a frame is encoded in the bytecode (the stackframe may be defined as the delta from the last
    //    stackframe in the bytecode), this form is not suitable for patching 
    //  - the expanded form, which get you the types of the local variables + stack which is easier to patch.
    //To get the expanded form, you have to pass EXPAND_FRAMES to the ClassReader.
    //
    //regards,
    //Rémi
    
    // NOTE: If this doesn't work, try to do what Remi said with regards to patching the existing stackmap frames.
